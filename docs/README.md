## 🎯 **Current Focus: FastAPI Application Improvements**

The **main project** (FastAPI application) has solid foundations but needs architectural improvements:

### **🚨 ARCHITECT VERDICT: Prototype Quality → Production Ready Required**

### **🔴 Critical Issues (Week 1-2) - ARCHITECT PRIORITY**
- **🏛️ Design Patterns**: Missing Command, Strategy, Factory patterns
- **🔧 SOLID Violations**: SRP violations in controllers (God methods)
- **🚫 Code Smells**: Data class smell, feature envy, N+1 queries
- **🔒 Security**: CORS vulnerability, weak JWT validation

### **🟡 High Priority (Week 3-4) - ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATION**  
- **Service Layer**: Extract business logic from controllers (78-line methods → 20-line)
- **Domain Models**: Convert anemic models to rich domain objects
- **Performance**: Fix N+1 query problems, bulk operations

### **🟢 Medium Priority (Week 5-6) - CLEAN CODE**
- **Magic Numbers**: Extract to business constants (8 violations found)
- **Parameter Objects**: Reduce method complexity
- **Unit Testing**: Add business logic tests (0% → 90% coverage)

### **🔵 Low Priority (Week 7+) - POLISH**
- **Advanced Patterns**: Decorator, Observer for extensibility
- **Performance**: Load testing, query optimization
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, health checks
